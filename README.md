# E. coli is a model organism. 
#The strain E. coli K-12 was isolated from the stool of a convalescent diphtheria patient in 1922, and it has been used in the lab for nearly 100 years. 
# It was one of the first organisms to have its whole genome sequenced. I
#It was such a big deal it was published in 1997 in Science! 
#Most researchers either buy their strain from a stock collection or know the history of their strain (
#These strains are going to Inevitably evolve over time. 
#Recently, researchers have returned back to these K-12 strains to resequence them and 
# ones that were derived (evolved) from the original K-12 strain


#This code is comparing Ecoli strains to the original K-12 strain
